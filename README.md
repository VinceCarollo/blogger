### Purpose

This was my first Rails app. The project itself was very hand holdy at first and became less this way during the late iterations. I learned a lot from this one but I would say my main takeaway here was learning what all the basic rails errors look like and how to handle them. It taught me about flash notices, rails forms, rails links, path helpers, restful routes and a plethora of other topics. This was a great way to jump into rails development and I would be were I am now without it.
